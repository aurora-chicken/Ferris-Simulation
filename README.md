### Ferris-Simulation
Made for math project.
## Problem
# Overall
Person is on a ferris wheel and you need to find when to drop them so they land safely in the water present in the car moving below
# Details
- Ferris wheel and cart start moving at the same time
- Ferris wheel has radius of 50ft
- The center of the ferris wheel is 65ft off the ground
- The ferris wheel and cart start moving at the same time
- Person starts at the 3 o' clock position on the ferris wheel
- When the ferris wheel starts turning it makes a full revolution every 40 seconds and is turning counter clockwise (it's turn rate doesn't change after that
- Cart starts 240ft left of the center of the ferris wheel
- The water in the cart is 8ft above ground level
- When the cart starts moving it's moving 15ft/s directly towards the ferris wheel (it's velocity (relative to earth/whatever this is on) doesn't change after this, but it will pass the ferris wheel and start moving away from it)
